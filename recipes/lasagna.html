    <h2>Classic Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>This Classic Homemade Lasagna is the ultimate comfort food, layered with rich flavors and hearty ingredients. It
        features tender sheets of pasta, a savory meat sauce made with ground beef and Italian sausage, creamy ricotta
        cheese blended with parmesan, and a generous amount of gooey mozzarella cheese that melts perfectly golden on
        top. The sauce is slow-simmered with garlic, onions, and Italian herbs, creating a deep, robust flavor that
        soaks into each layer. Between the pasta and cheese, each bite delivers a delicious balance of texturesâ€”soft
        noodles,creamy filling, and slightly crisp edges. Perfect for family dinners, gatherings, or meal prep, this
        lasagna not only tastes amazing fresh out of the oven but also reheats beautifully the next day. Pair it with a
        simple green salad and some garlic bread for a comforting, satisfying meal that everyone will love.
