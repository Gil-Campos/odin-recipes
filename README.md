# üç≥ Recipe Web Page

Welcome to my **Recipe Web Page**! This is one of the first projects I'm building as part of [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal of this project is to practice and apply the basic HTML skills I've been learning so far.

This simple web page showcases a few of my favorite recipes. It includes:

- A **main index page** that links to individual recipe pages
- Clean and structured **HTML** to build the content
- Use of headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images to make the content easy to read and navigate

### üöÄ What I'm Learning
This project helps me strengthen my understanding of:
- Writing semantic HTML
- Structuring a multi-page website
- Organizing files and linking between pages
- Building a strong foundation for future web development projects

Stay tuned for more improvements as I progress through **The Odin Project** and continue learning about CSS, JavaScript, and beyond!
